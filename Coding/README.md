# **How to run our code?** 

**Please run Cleaning_Data.ipynb and get feature_df.csv. Afterwards, please run Analysis_Data.ipynb to get our analysis there.**

# **File instruction**

**Cleaning_Data.ipynb: We read dataset which we collected by ourselves and do filtering, FFT there. Most importantly, output the feature_df.csv for Analysis Data part.**

**Analysis_Data.ipynb: We do analyze for this part. Main approach will be Machine Learning tools by using feature_df.csv. Moreover, there are also some statistics analysis in this part as well as plotting the graph.**

**Sensor data: All our data are stay in this file. For each category, they are downstairs_hold, downstairs_inpocket, falldown_hold, falldown_inpocket, upstairs_hold, upstairs_inpocket, walk_hold, walk_inpocket. In addition, there are 15 csv file for each category and total 120 csv files.**

**Picture for report: Some pictures are in our project.**

**Cleaning_Data.py: Just use for import**
